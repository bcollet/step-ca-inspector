# StepCA Inspector

StepCA Inspector is a companion app to
[step-ca](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/) that exposes Prometheus
metrics about your CA and offer API endpoints to get x509 and SSH certificate
data.

Additionally it can serve as a
[webhook](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/webhooks/) endpoint for
certificate validation.

A CLI client is available
[here](https://git.alt.tf/bcollet/step-ca-inspector-client/).
